#  Actor Interfaces

In this repository you'll find reusable packages/modules that are intended to be used by actors written in languages like **Go**, **Rust**, **Zig**, and **AssemblyScript**. Each of the reusable modules (HTTP server, HTTP client, Message Broker, Key-Value Store, etc) are thin veneers wrapping code generated from a **WIDL** schema.
